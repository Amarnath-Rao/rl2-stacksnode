# StacksNode
Securely annotate and store your PDF documents

## Inspiration
The inspiration for SafeNotes came from the noticeable lack of privacy when taking notes online on important documents. We recognized this gap and decided to address it.

## What it does
SafeNotes is a platform that allows users to securely annotate and store PDF documents. It's designed to provide a safe space for your notes and documents.

## How we built it
We leveraged Blockstack, React, and PDF.js to build the core functionalities of SafeNotes. For the annotation feature, we utilized [react-pdf-highlighter](https://github.com/agentcooper/react-pdf-highlighter).

## Challenges and Accomplishments
While Blockstack was easy to use, we did face some challenges along the way. However, overcoming these obstacles and delivering the project within a tight deadline is an accomplishment we're proud of.

## Learnings
Through this project, we gained a deeper understanding of how Blockstack's storage, identity, and encryption work.

## Future Plans for StacksNode
We're planning to enhance StacksNode by:
- Increasing the maximum file size allowed
- Adding collaboration features
- Enabling sharing options
- Supporting more formats
